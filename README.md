## Projects Overview

### File Handling Exercises

These exercises cover various aspects of file handling in C, including:

1. **Creating and Writing to a File**: Exercises on how to create new files and write data to them.
2. **Reading from a File**: Exercises on how to read data from existing files.
3. **Appending Data to a File**: Exercises on adding new data to the end of an existing file.
4. **File Error Handling**: Exercises on handling file errors and ensuring robust file operations.

The exercises are intended to build a solid foundation in file handling, which is crucial for many C programming tasks.

## Libraries Used

The following libraries are used in these exercises:

- **`<stdio.h>`**: Provides functions for standard input and output operations, including file handling functions such as `fopen()`, `fprintf()`, `fscanf()`, `fclose()`, etc.
- **`<string.h>`**: Contains functions for manipulating and comparing strings, useful for file operations involving text data.
